[Xieyuanli Chen](https://xieyuanli-chen.com) ([SuMa++](https://github.com/PRBonn/semantic_suma/) and [OverlapNet](https://github.com/PRBonn/OverlapNet) lead author) graduated from the University of Bonn with the highest scores in the lab's history and currently serves as an Associate Professor at the National University of Defense Technology. During my PhD studies, Professor Chen provided invaluable guidance and support. With his assistance, we co-authored two significant papers: [360-VIO](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373205) and [NeRF-LOAM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10377635), which were accepted by TIE and ICCV, respectively. Professor Chen is not only skilled in algorithm development but is also enthusiastic and responsible, making him an exemplary figure in my academic journey. For those with innovative ideas in the autonomous driving field, I highly recommend contacting him via email to explore collaboration opportunities.
