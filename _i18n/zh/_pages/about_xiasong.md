[Song Pengcheng Xia](https://xspc.github.io/zh/) was both a classmate and roommate of mine during my PhD studies. Currently, we are collaborating on a paper, [DynaIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02196.pdf), which has been accepted for CVPR2024. Shia Song's primary research focuses on motion capture based on sparse observations (utilizing contact and non-contact sensors like IMUs, VR, Radar), continuous activity segmentation and recognition (enhanced by synthetic data generation and weak supervision), and human motion analysis for movement health applications (disease diagnosis and exercise applications). Throughout his academic journey, he has received numerous accolades including the **Undergraduate National Scholarship, Outstanding Graduate, Top 1% Award at Wuhan University, and the PhD National Scholarship of China**. He is modest, diligent, and highly efficient in his work. Over the past five years, his relentless spirit and effort in research have not only earned him many academic honors but also profoundly inspired me to advance on the academic path. He is currently actively seeking a postdoctoral position.
